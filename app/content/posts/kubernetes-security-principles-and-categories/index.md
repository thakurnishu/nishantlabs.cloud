*Security is complex and a process.*  
 - Attackers always have the advantage.
 - With a changing environment, security can't stay still.
{{< /lead >}}

In this blog, I will be sharing some of the **Kubernetes security principles and categories**.

## Some Security Principles
- **Limiting Attack Surface:** Always look for ways to reduce areas where an attacker can harm you.
- **Defense in Depth:** Always have multiple layers of security and redundancy.
- **Least Privilege:** Always give the least permissions required to complete a task.

## Kubernetes Security Categories

#### Host Operating System Security
In **managed Kubernetes clusters**, this is managed by the cloud provider.  
But we should know how to manage it if we ever need to run a cluster from the ground up.

- A **Kubernetes node** should only do one thing, and that is _Kubernetes_ — meaning no other services should be running other than Kubernetes components like `containerd`, `kubelet`, etc. Here, I recommend looking at [**Talos**](https://www.talos.dev/) Linux distro for Kubernetes.
- **Reduce the attack surface** by removing unnecessary applications from nodes and keeping them **up to date**.
- Use runtime security tools like **_Seccomp_**, **_AppArmor_**, **_SELinux_**, and many more.
- Restrict access to nodes via **SSH and IAM**.  
  ⚠️ **DO NOT GIVE ACCESS TO ANYONE without a particular reason.**

#### Kubernetes Cluster Security
In **managed Kubernetes clusters**, this is also managed by the cloud provider.  
Let's see some of the things on the cluster level.

- All **Kubernetes components** like the **API Server, Kubelet, ETCD, and others** should be **up to date and running securely**.
- **Restrict access** to the Kubernetes API server from outside of your network.
- **Admission controllers** provide various security plugins that you can enable for your cluster, both mutating and validating.
- **Enable audit logging** on the cluster for checking `who did what, when, and from where`.
- Data in **ETCD should be encrypted**.

#### Applications Security
Even in **managed Kubernetes environments**, you are **fully responsible** for this layer of security.  
Some of the basic things one should do are mentioned below.

- **Always use secrets**, never hardcode any credentials.
- Use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to give access to anyone in the team.
- Use **container sandboxing** by isolating containers from the host system. Even if an attacker gets access to a container, your host machine is safe.
- Apply **container hardening** by:  
  - Running containers as **non-root users**.  
  - Having **read-only filesystems**.  
  - Using **network policies**.  
  - Running **secure container images**.  
- **Always scan container images** using vulnerability scanning tools and create **secure container images**.
- Use **mTLS** and **service meshes**.
